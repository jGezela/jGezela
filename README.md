# Hi there <img src="https://cdn3.emoji.gg/emojis/2112_wave_animated.gif" width="32px" height="32px">

I'm Jakub but everyone calls me Gazela. I'm currently an engineering student at Poznan University of Technology and an aspiring full-stack web developer. Most of my free time I spend building random projects that help me solve my tiny problems. My main goal in the future is to build things that will help people with their businesses and everyday dilemmas.
